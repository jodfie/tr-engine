# tr-engine

Backend service that ingests data from [trunk-recorder](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder) instances and serves it via a REST API with real-time streaming. Handles radio system monitoring data: calls, talkgroups, units, transcriptions, live audio, and recorder state.

Zero configuration for radio systems — tr-engine discovers systems, sites, talkgroups, and units automatically. Point it at a broker, a watch directory, or a trunk-recorder install, give it a database, and it figures out the rest.

> **Note:** This is a ground-up rewrite of the original tr-engine, now archived at [LumenPrima/tr-engine-v0](https://github.com/LumenPrima/tr-engine-v0). The database schema is not compatible. If you're coming from v0, see the **[migration guide](docs/migrating-from-v0.md)**.

## Tech Stack

- **Go** — multi-core utilization at high message rates
- **PostgreSQL 17+** — partitioned tables, JSONB, denormalized for read performance
- **MQTT + File Watch** — ingests from trunk-recorder via MQTT or filesystem monitoring (or both)
- **REST API** — 80+ endpoints under `/api/v1`, defined in `openapi.yaml`
- **SSE** — real-time event streaming with server-side filtering
- **Live Audio** — UDP simplestream ingest with per-talkgroup Opus encoding, WebSocket delivery
- **Transcription** — pluggable STT providers (Whisper, ElevenLabs, DeepInfra, IMBE ASR)
- **Web UI** — built-in dashboards and companion [tr-dashboard](https://github.com/trunk-reporter/tr-dashboard) React app

## Quick Start

Run this from your trunk-recorder directory (requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)):

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunk-reporter/tr-engine/master/install.sh | sh
```

That's it. Open http://localhost:8080 — call recordings will appear as trunk-recorder captures them.

To remove: `cd tr-engine && docker compose down -v && cd .. && rm -rf tr-engine`

## Other Installation Methods

- **[Docker Compose](docs/docker.md)** — full setup with PostgreSQL, MQTT broker, and tr-engine
- **[Docker with existing MQTT](docs/docker-external-mqtt.md)** — connect to a broker you already run
- **[Docker full stack](docs/docker-full-stack.md)** — PostgreSQL + Mosquitto + tr-engine + tr-dashboard + Caddy
- **[Build from source](docs/getting-started.md)** — compile from source, bring your own PostgreSQL
- **[Binary releases](docs/binary-releases.md)** — download a pre-built binary, just add PostgreSQL
- **[HTTP Upload](docs/http-upload.md)** — ingest calls via trunk-recorder's rdio-scanner or OpenMHz upload plugins (no MQTT or shared filesystem needed)

## Updating

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Database and audio files persist in Docker volumes across updates.

## Authentication

tr-engine has three auth modes, determined by which environment variables you set:

| Config | Mode | Behavior |
|--------|------|----------|
| Neither `AUTH_TOKEN` nor `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | **Open** | No auth — all endpoints accessible |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` set | **Token** | Shared API token required for all access |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set | **Full** | JWT login with role-based access. Optional public read access via `AUTH_TOKEN`. |

The `GET /api/v1/auth-init` endpoint returns the current auth mode so clients (tr-dashboard, web UI) can automatically detect what's needed — no proxy injection or manual config required.

**For public-facing deployments:** Set both `AUTH_TOKEN` (public read access) and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (admin login for writes). Put behind a reverse proxy with TLS.

**For private/local use:** Set `AUTH_TOKEN` for basic protection, or leave both unset for open access.

See **[Auth Migration Guide](docs/migrating-auth.md)** if upgrading from `WRITE_TOKEN`/`AUTH_ENABLED` (both deprecated).

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded in priority order: **CLI flags > environment variables > .env file > defaults**.

The `.env` file is auto-loaded from the current directory on startup. See `sample.env` for all available fields.

### CLI Flags

```
--listen        HTTP listen address (default :8080)
--log-level     debug, info, warn, error (default info)
--database-url  PostgreSQL connection URL
--mqtt-url      MQTT broker URL
--audio-dir     Audio file directory (default ./audio)
--watch-dir     Watch TR audio directory for new files
--tr-dir        Path to trunk-recorder directory for auto-discovery
--env-file      Path to .env file (default .env)
--version       Print version and exit
```

### Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `MQTT_BROKER_URL` | * | | MQTT broker URL (e.g., `tcp://localhost:1883`) |
| `WATCH_DIR` | * | | Watch TR audio directory for new files |
| `TR_DIR` | * | | Path to trunk-recorder directory for auto-discovery |
| `MQTT_TOPICS` | No | `#` | MQTT topic filter (match your TR plugin prefix with `/#`) |
| `HTTP_ADDR` | No | `:8080` | HTTP listen address |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | No | | Shared API token (token mode) or public read token (full mode) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | No | | Enables JWT login, seeds admin user on first run |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | No | `*` | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins |
| `RATE_LIMIT_RPS` | No | `20` | Per-IP rate limit (requests/second) |
| `AUDIO_DIR` | No | `./audio` | Audio file storage directory |
| `STT_PROVIDER` | No | `whisper` | Transcription provider: `whisper`, `elevenlabs`, `deepinfra`, `imbe` |
| `STREAM_LISTEN` | No | | UDP listen address for live audio (e.g., `:9123`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level |

\* At least one of `MQTT_BROKER_URL`, `WATCH_DIR`, or `TR_DIR` must be set. All three can run simultaneously.

See `sample.env` for the full list including MQTT credentials, HTTP timeouts, transcription tuning, S3 storage, and retention settings.

### Audio Modes

tr-engine supports two modes for call audio:

- **MQTT audio (default):** trunk-recorder sends base64-encoded audio in MQTT messages. tr-engine decodes and saves the files to `AUDIO_DIR`. Enable with `mqtt_audio: true` in trunk-recorder's MQTT plugin config.

- **Filesystem audio (`TR_AUDIO_DIR`):** trunk-recorder saves audio to its local filesystem. tr-engine serves them directly. Set `TR_AUDIO_DIR` to trunk-recorder's `audioBaseDir`. When using this mode, set `mqtt_audio_type: none` in the TR plugin config to skip base64 encoding.

Both modes can coexist during a transition.

## How It Works

### Ingest Modes

tr-engine supports four ingest modes that can run independently or simultaneously:

- **MQTT** — subscribes to trunk-recorder's MQTT status plugin for real-time call events, unit activity, recorder state, decode rates, trunking messages, and console logs. The richest data source.
- **File Watch** (`WATCH_DIR`) — monitors trunk-recorder's audio output directory for new `.json` metadata files. Only produces `call_end` events. Backfills existing files on startup (`WATCH_BACKFILL_DAYS`).
- **TR Auto-Discovery** (`TR_DIR`) — the simplest setup. Point at trunk-recorder's directory. Auto-discovers capture directory, system names, imports talkgroup and unit CSVs. With `CSV_WRITEBACK=true`, alpha_tag edits are written back to the CSV files.
- **HTTP Upload** (`POST /api/v1/call-upload`) — accepts multipart uploads compatible with trunk-recorder's rdio-scanner and OpenMHz upload plugins. No local audio capture or MQTT broker required. Authenticates via API key (`tre_` prefix), bearer token, or form field key.

### Auto-Discovery

tr-engine builds its model of the radio world automatically from incoming messages:

1. **Identifies systems** by matching P25 `(sysid, wacn)` pairs or conventional `(instance_id, sys_name)`
2. **Discovers sites** within each system — multiple TR instances monitoring the same P25 network auto-merge into one system with separate sites
3. **Tracks talkgroups and units** as they appear in call and unit events

```
System "MARCS" (P25 sysid=348, wacn=BEE00)
  |- Site "butco"  (nac=340, instance=tr-1)
  |- Site "warco"  (nac=34D, instance=tr-2)
  |- Talkgroups (shared across all sites)
  +- Units (shared across all sites)
```

### Data Flow

```
trunk-recorder  ──MQTT──>  broker  ──MQTT──>  tr-engine  ──REST/SSE──>  clients
      |                                            |
      +──audio files──>  fsnotify watcher ─────────+
      |                                            |
      +──HTTP upload──>  POST /call-upload ────────+
      |                                            |
      +──simplestream UDP──> audio router ─────────+──WebSocket──> live audio
                                                   v
                                               PostgreSQL
```

## Real-Time Event Streaming

`GET /api/v1/events/stream` pushes filtered events over SSE.

- **Filter params** (all optional, AND-ed): `systems`, `sites`, `tgids`, `units`, `types`, `emergency_only`
- **8 event types**: `call_start`, `call_update`, `call_end`, `unit_event`, `recorder_update`, `rate_update`, `trunking_message`, `console`
- **Compound type syntax**: `types=unit_event:call` filters by subtype
- **Reconnect**: `Last-Event-ID` header for gapless recovery (60s server-side buffer)

## Live Audio Streaming

`GET /audio/live` delivers real-time radio audio via WebSocket.

- **UDP ingest** from trunk-recorder's simplestream plugin (`STREAM_LISTEN`)
- **Per-talkgroup Opus encoding** (configurable bitrate, PCM passthrough option)
- **Multi-site deduplication** — same call from multiple sites sent once
- **Subscribe/unsubscribe filtering** by system IDs and talkgroup IDs
- **Browser playback** via AudioWorklet (`audio-engine.js` + `audio-worklet.js`)

## Transcription

Pluggable speech-to-text with four providers:

| Provider | Config | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Whisper | `STT_PROVIDER=whisper` + `WHISPER_URL` | Self-hosted or cloud Whisper-compatible API |
| ElevenLabs | `STT_PROVIDER=elevenlabs` + `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | ElevenLabs Scribe API |
| DeepInfra | `STT_PROVIDER=deepinfra` + `DEEPINFRA_STT_API_KEY` | Hosted Whisper models |
| IMBE ASR | `STT_PROVIDER=imbe` + `IMBE_ASR_URL` | Transcribes directly from P25 IMBE codec frames via DVCF |

Features: configurable worker pool, queue size, duration filters, anti-hallucination parameters, `provider_ms` performance tracking, talkgroup include/exclude filtering.

### tr-dashboard

For a full-featured React dashboard with talkgroup favorites, call playback, unit investigation, and live audio, see **[tr-dashboard](https://github.com/trunk-reporter/tr-dashboard)**. It connects to tr-engine's API and auto-detects auth mode via `/api/v1/auth-init`.

## Storage Estimates

Observed with 2 moderately busy counties and 1 trunk-recorder instance:

| Category | Estimated Annual Usage |
|----------|----------------------|
| Database (permanent tables) | ~22 GB/year |
| Database (state + logs overhead) | ~3 GB steady-state |
| Audio files (M4A) | ~140 GB/year |

High-volume tables (calls, unit_events, trunking_messages) are automatically partitioned by month. Partition maintenance runs daily, creating partitions 3 months ahead. State tables are decimated (1/min after 1 week, 1/hour after 1 month). Configurable retention via `RETENTION_*` env vars.
